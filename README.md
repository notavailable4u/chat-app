# Project Name: React Native Mobile Chat App

## Project Description
This project was created as part of the curriculum for the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Career Foundry] (https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) [^1]. More to come later...

[^1]: If you are considering enrolling in the Full Stack Web Development Program at Career Foundry, I cannot strongly enough caution you to NOT ENROLL. The lessons are filled with so much deprecated code and blatant errors that it is criminal. Feel free to contact me if you would like more detailed information.
